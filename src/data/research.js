    description:
      'We study how distance to one\u2019s polling place affects the likelihood of voting using a geographic regression discontinuity design with data from Pennsylvania and Georgia. A one-mile increase in distance to polling place reduces the likelihood of voting in person by 2 to 3 percentage points. Effects are two to four times higher among those closest to the polling place. When available, voters substitute to mail-in voting as distance to polling place increases. We estimate a discrete-choice voting model to identify turnout-maximizing polling places. Some precincts have large potential gains in turnout, even when choosing from existing buildings.',

      'The paper provides the first assessment of: (i) America\u2019s progress in lifting the lower bound\u2014the floor\u2014of the distribution of real income; (ii) whether the country\u2019s largest antipoverty program, SNAP (\u201Cfood stamps\u201D), helped do so. An operational method of estimating the floor is implemented on micro survey data spanning 30 years, with various robustness and significance tests. SNAP partially compensated the poorest, and helped stabilize the floor. Nonetheless, the floor has been sinking over the last 30 years. The efficiency of SNAP in lifting the floor has declined over time. Full coverage of the poorest would lift the floor appreciably.',

    description:
      'It is theoretically ambiguous whether people in richer countries have a higher floor to their living standards. Nor is it clear whether social protection spending reaches the poorest and thus lifts the floor. Across countries, the paper finds that higher mean incomes come with a higher floor. The bulk of this is direct rather than via public spending on social protection. Social insurance (mainly public pensions) does the \u201Cheavy lifting\u201D of the floor. Social assistance (mainly targeted cash-transfers) lifts the floor by only 1.5 cents per day on average, which is less than 10% of mean spending on social assistance.',
